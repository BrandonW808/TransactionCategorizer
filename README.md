# TransactionCategorizer Service Refactoring

This folder contains the refactored services for the TransactionCategorizer application. The main goal of the refactoring was to move away from class-based services to function-based services, since the services are non-stateful and relatively simple.

## Changes Made

1. Converted service classes to exported functions:
   - Removed the `CategoryListService` class and replaced it with individual exported functions
   - Removed the `UserService` class and replaced it with individual exported functions

2. Updated all imports and references in the routes files:
   - Changed named imports to namespace imports (`import * as categoryListService from ...`)
   - Updated all method calls from `CategoryListService.method()` to `categoryListService.method()`
   - Updated all method calls from `UserService.method()` to `userService.method()`

3. Updated server.ts to use the new function-based approach

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: The services are now simpler and more direct, with no unnecessary class wrapper.

2. **Better Testing**: Individual functions are easier to test than class methods.

3. **Tree Shaking**: Named exports allow for better tree-shaking in modern bundlers.

4. **Clarity**: The code intention is clearer - these are stateless utility functions rather than methods that operate on an object's state.

5. **Consistency**: The function-based approach is more consistent with modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices for this kind of stateless service.
